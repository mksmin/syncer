# Testing on iOS

1. Build `main.js`; copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` to
   `<vault>/<vault.configDir>/plugins/syncer/` using supported file transfer.
2. Enable community plugins and Syncer. Confirm manifest shows mobile support.
3. Press `Авторизоваться`, finish confirmation-code authorization, run `Проверить` and choose a
   remote folder through `Выбрать…`. No Client ID field should be visible.
4. Run `Создать новый план синхронизации`; v0.9 must open the modal immediately, append remote data
   in batches, show progress and make zero file changes.
5. Expand every section. Check long paths wrap, lists scroll, blocked deletion candidates open
   automatically and no row escapes screen width.
6. Test 1,000+ paths, Cyrillic, spaces, `#`, `%`, `?`, nested/empty folders and binary names.
7. Background app, lock screen, switch network, cancel. No following request may start after
   interruption.
8. Confirm folder picker navigation, back, selecting root and an empty folder on iPhone width.
9. Confirm no `fs`, `path`, `electron`, `child_process`, `FileSystemAdapter`, Axios or direct
   `fetch` in bundle/source.
10. Test revoked token, offline/timeout, missing root and cancellation. 429/Retry-After and partial
    pagination are covered by HTTP mocks; reproduce manually when practical.
11. In a disposable vault, create a new sync plan, select each action and verify their scope. Rows
    must show remote/local size and modification dates.
12. Change a local file after dry run but before confirmation. Sync must refuse that overwrite and
    show a per-file error.
13. Test every background rule. Startup, timer and `Синхронизировать в фоне сейчас` must run without
    opening a modal or asking confirmation. A remote deletion must never remove or trash its local
    file.
14. Repeat background sync within 60 seconds. Confirm it reports use of cache, makes no new listing
    request and does not propose already completed updates. Immediate repeated write must show
    cooldown. A new manual plan must bypass that cache.
15. During background sync create a new plan or run background sync manually. The same session must
    reopen with current stage/progress. Stop it from the modal and confirm no next job starts.
16. Download Markdown, PNG, JPEG, GIF, PDF and DOCX files. No content response may produce
    `JSON Parse error`; checksum/size validation must still run before every Vault write.
17. With a backup and disposable file, remove it remotely. First all-sync after root change must
    establish baseline without trash. Reopen plan, choose `Без удалений`, then repeat and choose
    `В корзину`. Confirm Obsidian trash contains the file.
18. Above count/percentage limits, verify warning, percentage and first 20 paths. Cancel, change one
    local candidate after plan and confirm it is refused. Any download/update error must block all
    trash operations.
19. Select individual new/update rows, close/reopen the modal and run selective sync. Only checked
    paths may change; trash must remain untouched. Expand a section beyond 200 rows with
    `Показать ещё` and verify selection remains stable.
20. Set parallel downloads to 5 on iPhone and confirm actual executor remains sequential. Repeat on
    desktop and confirm configured concurrency is preserved.
21. Run production build and `check:mobile-bundle`; audit must pass. Test 1,500+ paths and watch for
    UI stalls or app termination while updating large binaries.
22. After a completed sync, change local and remote files, press `Пересобрать план` and confirm both
    changes appear. Enable a timer, confirm one background run, then disable it and confirm no more
    runs start. iOS may pause timers while Obsidian is backgrounded.

Manual matrix: current iPhone/iOS, iPadOS, macOS/Windows desktop; Wi-Fi/mobile/weak/offline;
Obsidian foreground/background/resume. Real iPhone verification remains release blocker outside
automated CI.
